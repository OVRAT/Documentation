# OVRAT - Open Source Virtual Reality Anatomy Training

OVRAT is an open source virtual reality application designed to provide medical students and professionals with a comprehensive and immersive training experience in anatomy. The application uses cutting-edge virtual reality technology to create a realistic and engaging environment that allows users to explore and interact with 3D models of the human body.

## Modules

The OVRAT project is divided into several modules, each with its own specific functionality:

### Frontend

The frontend module is responsible for the user interface and user experience of the application. This module is built using modern web technologies such as React, Redux, and WebGL.

### Backend

The backend module is responsible for managing the data and logic of the application. This module is built using Node.js and MongoDB, and provides REST APIs for the frontend module to interact with.

### AR & VR

The AR & VR module is responsible for creating the virtual reality environment and providing the user with an immersive experience. This module is built using Unity 3D and supports both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices.

### AI Solutions

The AI Solutions module is responsible for providing intelligent features to the application, such as automated diagnosis and recommendations. This module is built using machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Points of Interest

The OVRAT project includes several points of interest, each with its own specific focus:

### Anatomy

The anatomy point of interest provides a detailed overview of the human body, including the skeletal, muscular, circulatory, and nervous systems.

### Surgery

The surgery point of interest provides a hands-on experience with surgical procedures, allowing users to practice surgical techniques in a safe and controlled environment.

### Diagnosis

The diagnosis point of interest provides an automated diagnosis feature that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and provide diagnostic recommendations.

## Licensing

OVRAT is an open source project, which means that the software is available to use, modify, and distribute under the terms of the MIT License. This license allows individuals and organizations to use the software for any purpose, including commercial use, without restriction, as long as the original copyright notice and license terms are included.

## Organizational Flow

OVRAT is a project created by Momeni Gilles and Daniel Tiomela, who are both third-year students at IAI Cameroon. The project is their end-of-year project for their course, and they have formed an organization to manage and develop the project.

The organization is structured as follows:
